/* MoToSyncStepper V3.0
** class to syncronise the movement of up to MAXSTEPPER steppers with acceleration and deceleration
** The stepper with the longest distance to move is the master. This movement is controlled in the
** ISR like a singel stepper. All other steppers that are closer to the target (slaves) 
** are controlled by the master, which sets the time for the next step of the slave steppers.
** During the synced movement no changes to the stepper objects are allowed.
